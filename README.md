# Vault

The Vault (:tm: *patient pending*) helps everyone manage complex bank account/routing. 

This simple CRUD app will make all your complex and secure online bank account look plain SILLY! Trust me :innocent:

## Things you'll need:
* ruby 2.5.x
* rails 5.2.2.1
* postgres 11.2
* node v11.12.0
* yarn 1.13.0

### Clone down, create, and run:
```
git@github.com:chastep/vault.git
cd vault
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
rails s
```

### Testing: RSpec
```
bundle exec rpsec
```

Just open a PR and push if you find something wrong with The Vault, any feedback would be greatly appreciated!
